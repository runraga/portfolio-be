# Portfolio Website Backend

### Short description

An express.js backend API for serving the portfolio website. The API pulls data from public GitHib repos to serve the Project cards.

### Languages used

- JavaScript
- GitHub Workflow

### Overview

I built this API to serve the portfolio website projects by pulling data from public GitHub repos. I separated it out from the front end website to avoid exposing the GitHub API key which is needed for subsequent calls to pull the README contents and project graphic. It also gave me an oppurtunity to play with full-stack development so I have an appreciation of the challenges of getting front-end and back-end working in harmony. For example I now have a really good understanding of cross origin resource sharing and intricacies of how requests to hosted websites are handled.

### Future Features

- Add additional API endpoints to reduce complexity of the returned data.
